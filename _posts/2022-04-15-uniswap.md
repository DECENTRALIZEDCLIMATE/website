We are the Decentralized Climate Foundation and we are very excited to announce that **DECA has been successfully added into the decentralized exchange Uniswap.** With this action, everyone will be able to get DECA tokens or exchange their DECA for ETH or other ERC20 tokens. 

Now it will be much easier to get DECA tokens!

This action allows more people to access a green, free and collaborative platform to unlock the benefits of carbon markets by using blockchain technology. DECA is a decentralized carbon credit based economy that reached the end of its ICO with a cumulative total of 17,768 tokens issued.

We invite DECA hodlers to provide liquidity in Uniswap to keep this project developing.

# About Uniswap #

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange — meaning it isn’t owned and operated by a single entity — and uses a relatively new type of trading model called an automated liquidity protocol.

The Uniswap platform was built in 2018 on top of the Ethereum blockchain, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency project by market capitalization, which makes it compatible with all ERC-20 tokens and infrastructure such as wallet services like MetaMask and MyEtherWallet.
