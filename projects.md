## Supported Projects 

### DECA 

The Decentralized Climate Foundation (DCF) is a non-profit organization that supports the DECA ecosystem and related technologies. DCF's role is to lead the development of DECA while the DAO development concludes, which will take DCF's role.

The foundation oversees the operation of this ecosystem in its transition towards decentralization and coordinates the free participation of citizens interested in supporting this project.

As a citizen effort, the foundation enables DECA to build its own informed community, capable of making decisions on behalf of the environment.
