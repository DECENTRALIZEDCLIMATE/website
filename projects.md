## Supported Projects 

### DECA 

The Decentralized Climate Foundation manages the organization, development and decision-making of DECA, a decentralized carbon-based economy.

The foundation oversees the operation of this economy in its transition towards decentralization and coordinates the free participation of citizens interested in supporting this project to fight climate change.

As a citizen effort, the foundation enables DECA to build its own informed community, capable of making decisions on behalf of the environment.
